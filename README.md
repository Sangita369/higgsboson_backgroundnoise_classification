# Higgs Boson Background Noise Classification using XGBoost

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify **Higgs Boson background noise** from **Large Hadron Collider (LHC) particle collision data**. We utilize the **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) model** to detect rare decay signals and differentiate them from background noise efficiently.

## 🔬 Why XGBoost?
XGBoost is chosen because:
- ✅ **High Accuracy**: Boosting technique reduces bias and variance.
- ✅ **Handles Large Datasets**: Efficient with large particle physics datasets.
- ✅ **Feature Importance**: Helps in understanding which parameters influence the classification most.
- ✅ **Speed and Performance**: Faster training with optimized tree-building algorithms.

## 🏗️ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Load LHC collision dataset
   - Handle missing values and feature selection
   - Data normalization & transformation
   
2. **Model Training (XGBoost Classifier)**
   - Split data into training and validation sets
   - Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance
   - Train the XGBoost model
   
3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score metrics
   - Confusion Matrix for visualizing classification performance

4. **Testing on New Data**
   - Apply trained model on test dataset
   - Generate predictions

## 📊 Results
- **Final Model Accuracy:** ~72.7%
- **Precision & Recall Metrics:** Balanced classification performance
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Helps in understanding key contributing factors
